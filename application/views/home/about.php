  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="lead">Why Did we create Voyagur?</p>
  <p>Mitch and Kevin had the idea for Voyagur after years of group travel that they painstakingly put together, organized, and executed. 
    They realized that a lot of what they spent hours doing could be easily automated by computers - more accurate and less
    time consuming. They quickly set out to make a simple online resource that helps relieve the pains of group travel so you can
    focus less of your time planning and communicating all the details and focus your time on enjoying your Voyage!!</p>
